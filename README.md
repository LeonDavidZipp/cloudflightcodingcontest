# Cloudflight Coding Contest
The coding contest took place on the 19th of April, 2024 at 42 Heilbronn. I joined as a one-man-team and completed 3 levels (as many as my locations 1. place, but in a longer timespan), finishing 13th out of 26. My programming language of choice was python, since code efficiency and performance were less important than typing speed. 

## Levels
All levels were practically split into 2 parts:
### 1. Input Parsing
The input had to be first read from the file. Afterwards it had to be passed to the functions correctly.
### 2. Program Logic 
The main challenge.

## Level 1: Passed
The first level 

## Level 2: Passed

## Level 3: Passed

## Level 4: Tried but failed
